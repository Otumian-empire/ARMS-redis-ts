# [ARMS-redis-ts]

ARMS is a management system for renting apartments. There are the tenants and land-lord, who is the admin. The admin registers apartments on ARMS, a tenant who is interested in renting from this land-lord registers for an apartment. Each apartment has its own detail, describing the basic interior of the room - provided by the admin, the cost for a term - a term is three month. This is just an API and there is a [postman collection](ARMS_Redis.postman_collection.json) that can be used to CRUD the entities involved.

## How it works

### Performance Benchmarks

[If you migrated an existing app to use Redis, please put performance benchmarks here to show the performance improvements.]

## How to run it locally?

### Prerequisites

- Node v16.15.0
- Redis Stack Server 7.0.0
- RedisInsight-v2 2.6.0 (to view the data)
- Postman or similar tool

### Local installation

- clone, `git clone https://github.com/Otumian-empire/ARMS-redis-ts.git`
- change into `ARMS-redis-ts`
- create a copy of the content of the [example env](.example.env) file into a file, `.env`.
- set `REDIS_URI=redis://127.0.0.1:6379` to use the local
- Install node packages, `npm i`
- Run node server, `npm run start`
- Import [postman collection](ARMS_Redis.postman_collection.json) into postman and visit the end routes

## Deployment

To make deploys work, you need to create free account on [Redis Cloud](https://redis.info/try-free-dev-to)
